### Hello, World!

This week we looked at C++, and we tried to implement two interesting algorithms or projects: [fizz buzz](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fizz_buzz) and [factorial](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Factorial). This won't turn you into a C++ wizard, but it will teach you basic C++, and it's a good way to get started.

Learning to code, and learning C++ is life long journey, below is list of articles, courses, books, blogs that will hellp you in this journey (I highly recommend that you go through them):
