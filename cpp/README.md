This week we looked at C++, and we tried to implement two interesting algorithms or projects: [fizz buzz](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fizz_buzz) and [factorial](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Factorial). This won't turn you into a C++ wizard (but you'd aim to be a [wizard](https://jvns.ca/blog/so-you-want-to-be-a-wizard/) like [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/about/)), but it will teach you basic C++, and it's a good way to get started.

Learning to code, and learning C++ is life long journey, below is list of articles, courses, books, blogs that will hellp you in this journey (I highly recommend that you go through them):

- Brian Bi's answer to ["What is the best approach to become more proficient at C++"](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-approach-to-become-more-proficient-at-C++/answer/Brian-Bi)
- If you have a Lynda.com/Linkedin Learning account, please checkout: [Become a C++ Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-c-plus-plus-developer)
- [This](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113) is a must read C++ book (if you wanna learn C++ the right way), you may also be interested in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list) Stackoverflow list of good C++ books.
- [Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas/about) has a great Youtube channel where he covers a lot of awesome stuff - including [C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DamuE8TM3xo&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvQ9S8YSV0iDsuEU8v11yP9M)
